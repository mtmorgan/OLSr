Description: The Ontology Lookup Service ('OLS') is a repository of
    biomedical ontologies provided by the European Bioinformatics
    Institute ('EMBL-EBI'). 'OLSr' provides an interface to this
    service, allowing discovery of ontologies, terms, and
    relations. Results are presented in a 'tidy' framework, so that
    manipulation tasks are easily accomplished with verbs such as
    'filter()', 'select()', and 'mutate()'. An effort is made to
    integrate with other packages useful for more comprehensive
    biological and ontological analysis.
